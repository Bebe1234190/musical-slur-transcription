=== TRANSFORMER-OPTIMIZED MIDI PROCESSING ===
Generated by: MIDI Piano Roll ML System v2.0 (Transformer Edition)
⚠️  TIMING METHOD: Raw MIDI ticks (ensures perfect alignment)
MIDI File: output/midis_for_evaluation_ground_truth_beethoven_sonata_no_16_hisamori_cut_mov_1.mid
Time Resolution: 0.00208333 quarter notes per tick
MIDI Resolution: 480 ticks per beat
Total Duration: 651.250 quarter notes

=== NOTE DATA ===
Total Notes: 3378
Overlapped Notes: 7 (handled properly)
Velocity Range: 26-104
Average Velocity: 61.0
Note data stored in CSV for transformer training (no matrix needed)

=== PEDAL MATRIX ===
Shape: (3, 312600)
Rows: [sustain, sostenuto, soft]
Values: 0=off, 1-127=pedal value
Total Pedal Events: 375
  - Sustain: 375
  - Sostenuto: 0
  - Soft: 0

=== SLUR ANNOTATION CATEGORIES ===
0: Empty/No annotation (default background)
1: Slur beginning (first note of slur)
2: Slur middle (continuation within slur)
3: Slur end (final note of slur)
4: No slur (explicitly isolated note)

=== TRANSFORMER TRAINING USAGE ===
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
pedal = np.load('midis_for_evaluation_ground_truth_beethoven_sonata_no_16_hisamori_cut_mov_1_pedal.npy')  # Shape: (3, 312600)
notes = pd.read_csv('midis_for_evaluation_ground_truth_beethoven_sonata_no_16_hisamori_cut_mov_1_slur_annotation.csv')
# Transformer uses note sequences + pedal context for slur prediction
# No large note matrix needed - optimized for sequence-based learning!
