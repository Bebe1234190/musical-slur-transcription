# Session Summary Paragraph

## December 2025 Session: Multi-Combination Evaluation & Classification System Improvements

This session focused on improving the classification system architecture and implementing comprehensive multi-trial evaluation across all possible train/val/test combinations. The primary achievement was migrating from BCELoss to CrossEntropyLoss for proper multi-class classification, which resolved the theoretical mismatch between model outputs (allowing multiple categories) and targets (enforcing mutual exclusivity). We added support for a 5th slur category (slur_start_and_end) to handle single-note slurs, expanding the model output from 4 to 5 classes. The session also implemented a comprehensive multi-combination training system that evaluates all 12 possible combinations of 4 pieces (2 for training, 1 for validation, 1 for testing), with support for multiple trials per combination to analyze variance. We added per-class analysis functionality to detect mode collapse and majority class over-prediction, and implemented automatic research summary report generation for mentor presentation. Additionally, we fixed MIDI processing to handle multi-track files correctly and expanded the dataset to 4 annotated pieces (~13,000 notes total). The evaluation revealed high variance in model performance (37.36% ± 15.92% test accuracy), indicating sensitivity to initialization, with best cases reaching 88.22% and worst cases showing mode collapse at 5.87%. The system now includes comprehensive analysis tools, research-ready reporting, and supports the full 5-category slur annotation system across all training and evaluation scripts.
